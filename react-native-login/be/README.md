# Backend for the react-native-login App

### Description
This is a first look at how to create a RESTful API Server with some authentication.
It is used by the react-native app, you can find it in the fe-Folder (Frontend).

I followed this tutorial: https://scotch.io/tutorials/authenticate-a-node-js-api-with-json-web-tokens and created a mongoDB for free here: https://mlab.com

### How to run
1. Open `cmd` or `bash` inside the be-Folder (I used cygwin on Windows).
2. Run: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run: `npm server.js` or `nodemon server.js` (nodemon will automatically restart the server after changing a file).
